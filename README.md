# Rick and Morty Character Card Website

[View Project](https://frosty-noyce-137b36.netlify.app)


This webpage accesses an online API through a Content Directory Network and displays the various characters in the array. This project was an exploration into manipulating arrays and appending them to the DOM. I used some Greensock animation in this project and explored basic JavaScript Concepts. This website displays data from a free Rick and Morty API onto baseball cards that have an animation where you can view the character's stats on the back of each card upon click. You can also filter the cards using built-in array methods attached to button elements.
